  """
  A prompt or suggestion that nudges the learner forward.
  Not tied to a specific wrong answer.
  Required.
  Example: "Replace the word inside curly brackets."
  """
  GENERAL_HINT


  """
  Tied to a specific error often in syntax.
  Used to provide targeted feedback for mistakes.
  Optional.
  Example: forgetting braces, requesting a non-existent field, etc.
  """
  COMMON_ERROR
  

  """
  Tied to a specific misconception.
  Triggered when a learner demonstrates an incomplete or inaccurate understanding.
  Optional.
  Example: requesting a subfield without first querying the parent field, demonstrating a misunderstanding of GraphQL schema structure.
  """
  COMMON_MISCONCEPTION

  """
  TODO: Future versions of hints should adapt dynamically based on learner's exploration readiness or cognitive engagement.
  High readiness â†’ more exploratory hints
  Medium readiness â†’ reinforcing hints that expand understanding
  Low readiness â†’ hints that focus on core concepts and direct guidance
